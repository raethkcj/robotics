# Robotics

A collection of Java packages implementing and demonstrating several introductory robotics concepts.

The majority of these packages are built with leJOS EV3 for the Lego Mindstorms EV3.

Project      | Platform                                         | Description
------------ | -----------                                      | -----------
DiffDriver   | EV3 Educator Vehicle                             | Differential Drive allowing forward and reverse linear motion and turns.
WallFollower | EV3 Educator Vehicle                             | Uses the Ultrasonic & Touch sensors to follow walls, turning left when it senses a gap and turning right on collisions.
WaveFront    | EV3 Educator Vehicle                             | Uses a swiveling Ultrasonic sensor and the Wavefront Planning algorithm to navigate a maze towards a known goal.
Segway       | Custom build based on Gelway (by Steven Witzand) | Attempts to balance on two wheels using the Gyroscopic sensor.
KinSim       | Desktop Java app                                 | Demonstrates forward and inverse robotic arm kinematics.
